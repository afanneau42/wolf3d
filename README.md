# **Wolf3d**
#### *It's the third project in the graphic branch.*

The subject asks to code a **C** program using the raycasting method to create a 3d looking game.
The user has to be able to move amd rotate. I did few bonuses like the minimap, the game menu and different levels with the possibility to edit maps.

We are allowed to use the **minilibx library** to manipulate a window and drow in it.
The main difficulties are to **apply the raycasting merhod** and **optimize the render**.

## **The render**

*Due to the recording the game ram a bit*

[![Watch the demo video](https://github.com/afanneau42/readme_ressources/blob/master/wolf3d/demo_wolf3d.png)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9iMmM2s15k)

## **Commands availables**

* Move						**Arrow keys**
* Sprint				**Shift**
* Quit						**ESC**

## **Disclaimer**

The minilibx version is for MacOs so it probably won't work on other OS.
